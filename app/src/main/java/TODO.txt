* Create a new launcher activity that checks to see if the current token is valid, and if it is,
go directly to the CategoryManagerView, otherwise show the login page.

* Separate the UI functionality from the data access layer. IE split TweetManager into two different
classes.

* Do the same as above for TwitterUserManager.

* Write some unit tests, Now that this is no longer a time-restricted school project.

* Create async tasks for contacting twitter and performing database operations, or somethign to that
effect

* Add setting for profile image quality.

* add setting to not load images at all, and perhaps show a placeholder.

* When the User clicks a profile image, display the original image in a new view.

* When loading the list of tweets (TweetsAdapter), you will have to check to see if the tweet is a retweet.
If it is, inflate a different view that will indicate a retweet, and then load the body of the tweet from the retweet table instead of the original tweet.

May not be the exact steps but should be a good guideline.

* Add the appropriate methods to the DAO Classes for persisting User and RetweetedUser Objects. See object code for TODOS.

* Create the appropriate methods in the DAO classes for deleting retweeted Users after X days. Add code to perform the cleanup.
